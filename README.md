- ⚡ Fun fact: ...The first computer “bug” was an actual bug!
In 1947, Grace Hopper and her team found a moth stuck inside a relay of the Harvard Mark II computer. They taped it into the logbook with the note “First actual case of bug being found.” 🪲💻
That’s how the term “debugging” became popular in programming.
